# Rust

<p >There was always a search for a dream Programming Language which will give the Performance/Control of near-Metal languages (C, C++) and safety of Runtime languages (Haskell/Python). Finally, Rust looks like “<strong>The Language that Promised</strong>” i.e. it gives the Performance/Control like C/C++ with the Safety of <a href="https://www.haskell.org/" data-href="https://www.haskell.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Haskell</em></strong></a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/" data-href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Python</em></strong></a>. Inspired by the research programming language <a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/" data-href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Cyclone (safer C)</em></strong></a>, <a href="https://github.com/graydon" data-href="https://github.com/graydon" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Graydon Hoare</em></strong></a> first developed Rust as a personal project which was later sponsored by <strong>Mozilla</strong> with active contribution from <strong>David Herman</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Brendan Eich</em></strong></a><em> </em><strong><em>(creator of JavaScript)</em></strong> and many others. Rust is a statically typed, compiled System Programming language which supports Functional and Imperative programming paradigm. First announced in 2010, its first stable version is released in 2015. With the concept of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Ownership</em> </strong></a>and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Borrowing</em></strong></a>, it offers the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>RAII </em></strong></a>from language level support and enables memory, thread-safe programming with the speed of C++ without any Garbage Collector or Virtual Machine. What really sets apart RUST from other near Metal languages (e.g. C/C++, Go) is that it gives the compile time safety i.e. if a Code compiles, it will run thread safe and memory safe as discussed in “<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html" data-href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Fearless Concurrency in Rust</strong></a>”. It also offers language level concurrency support for both Shared Memory Concurrency and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-02-message-passing.html" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-02-message-passing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Message Passing Concurrency (via Channel)</em></strong></a> although it still lacks Asynchronous event-loop based Concurrency (in development). Here is an excellent talk by <em>Alex Crichton</em> from Mozilla explaining Rust Concurrency:</p>

<p>Rust also has expressive types and numeric types like ML languages/Haskell and has immutable data structure by default. As a result, it offers excellent functional Concurrency and data Concurrency like ML languages/Haskell. As both Rust and <a href="https://webassembly.org/" data-href="https://webassembly.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Web Assembly (the next big thing in Browser)</em></strong></a> are developed by Mozilla, high performant and fast Rust code can directly be converted to Web Assembly to run on Browser. Another very interesting feature is that Rust has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140815054745/http://blog.mozilla.org/graydon/2010/1" data-href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140815054745/http://blog.mozilla.org/graydon/2010/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>self-hosted Compiler</em></strong></a> i.e. Compiler of Rust is written in Rust (After 23 years, Java not yet has self-hosted Compiler). Rust is also a great language in the Data Intensive domain due to its memory safe, data race free, zero cost abstraction, concurrency features. The Service Mesh platform <a href="https://linkerd.io/" data-href="https://linkerd.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Linkered</em> </strong></a>is migrated from <strong>Scala+Netty+Finagle Stack to Rust</strong> and achieved much better performance and resource utilization. The Data Intensive runtime <a href="https://www.weld.rs/" data-href="https://www.weld.rs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Weld </em></strong></a>which is written in Rust can give up to <strong>30x performance gain</strong> for Data Intensive frameworks (e.g. Spark).</p>
